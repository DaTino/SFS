    Once upon a time, there was an awesome dude named Jimmy Fishingpole. Jimmy used to go to all the neat fishing spots in Calloway county. One day, while fishing, Jimmy saw a beautiful woman sitting nearby. "Hi, my name's Jimmy Fishingpole", said Jimmy. The woman, a smoking hot red-head, was playing the mandolin in this crazy hot way. She smiled at Jimmy, got up, and walked away.
    Later that night, Jimmy was at home drinking some brewskis while watching the news. It cut to live footage of the woman setting fire to a childrens hospital. "Shit," said Jimmy to himself, "that girl is hard core." It turned out she was hard core, as she led the police on a five state manhead, only losing them around Murfreesboro. Jimmy would later hear that she fled to Azerbaijan and became a prominent animal rights activist.
